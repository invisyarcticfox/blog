So, it seems Cloudflare kind of just doesn't care about Pages anymore?

Everywhere you go that's about Pages, Cloudflare says "**HEY!!! USE WORKERS NOW!! ITS BETTER!!!**"
Like, they *really* want you to use Workers for things now.

<Image src={pages} alt={'pages'} loading={'eager'} width={720} />
<Image src={docs} alt={'docs'} loading={'eager'} width={720} />
<Image src={dash} alt={'dash'} loading={'eager'} width={720} />

Usually, I actually wouldn't move to a different workflow<sup>(?)</sup> just because the company behind it told me to.
Just like how I haven't changed the Twitter logo on the index of my site, it's still Twitter and I don't want to use the dumb new "ùïè" logo. I have to stay on an older version of [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org) just so I can use that icon because it got removed later on.<sup>[[i]](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/releases/tag/12.0.0)</sup>

So, over the past week I've been moving everything that *was* Pages to Workers purely because Astro doesn't support the version of Node that Pages uses. But also it is pretty easy anyway, I just need to use a couple more files and CF just knows what to do.

*Now upon writing this, I realised CF released Pages v3 which does have an updated version of Node, but I've already moved to Workers anyway so ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø (knew I shouldn't've deleted the original pages project smh)*
