Thought it'd be nice to get a blog running, gonna just post about cool stuff I do.
Either stuff like code I've written, or perhaps some stuff about animation.

Was thinking of just maybe posting this sort of stuff on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/invisyarcticfox),
but *ehh* I don't think half of the people following me would want a monthly ramble about random stuff lol.

At least here you actively have to go out of you way and come here ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

The style of this page is probably going to change overtime, along side with my [main website](https://invisyarcticfox.uk),
haven't quite figured out a style for myself yet other than using [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com) "Mocha".
Hell I'm still learning how to even use [Astro](https://astro.build) lmao
