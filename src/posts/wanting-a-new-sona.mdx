Recently, I've been wanting to make a new fursona, completely separate from my main sona.

Over the past few months I've been slowly adding stuff to my current sona that represent me irl.
Most notably the [Kiltro hoodie](https://kiltro-music.myshopify.com/products/pre-order-cincinero-hooded-sweatshirt-black) and longer hair.

</div>

But now, I just want a sona that represents me entirely. I'm not thinking of replacing my current sona just yet, and I'm not planning on making these changes to him either, just a completely new sona.

In hindsight, this phrasing is kind of strange, a fursona is *supposed* to represent you, it's a play-on-words of "persona", but I made this sona so many years ago that it really just doesn't represent me anymore.

### First, one of the changes I'm most definitely making is the name.

My current sona's name is "Invisy". There was absolutely **zero** thought when coming up with this name.
The "lore" is literally just this and it's rather weird; in fiction where a character has an "*invisible friend*", they're always named "Invis" or something. So I thought "hey, what if I add the next letter? That's unique enough!" and so I did, but with a "y".

So what I'm doing to do this time is just use my irl name. It's what I've been doing anyway and I never actually use my sona's name except for usernames and *obviously* my domain.

### Secondly, the design.

To be honest, I've been starting to dislike the bright colours all across his design. I know sonas can have any colours you like and most definitely doesn't have to be realistic, but some things just don't work for me anymore, especially the blue stripes across his body. I am most definitely not keeping that if I end up designing a new sona.

However, there are things that I might keep! The first one that comes to mind is the bite out of his ear.

<Image src={bite} alt={'bite'} width={720} />

I love this detail! There's no lore or backstory behind it, just a nice little detail and saves him from being too symmetrical.

The second design choice that I'll keep might be some accessories.
A bit ago, I added an industrial piercing to my sona on the opposite ear to his bite, again making him less symmetrical.

I don't actually have any piercings irl and, to be honest, I'm probably not going to get any anytime soon, but I *do* have a spiked choker and I added that quite a while ago too! It's not exactly the same, so I may change it just slightly.

Now, about the hair.

Semi-recently, I decided I wanted to make my sona's hair longer. I've already mentioned it earlier but I wanted to change it so it moreso represents me irl.

<Image src={irlhair} alt={'irlhair'} height={720} quality={'high'} />

This is what I (and my hair) look like, *quite* long and bleached at the ends. It obviously isn't the vibrant blue hair of my sona, and it most definitely doesn't just sit behind my neck, I like it all to wrap around to the front and sit on my shoulders.

When adding the longer hair to my sona, I couldn't find hair that was long enough and that wrapped around to the front, and I'm not even sure if it would look good with the current "mohawk" hair, and I certainly couldn't find any hair that was a perfect match so I just used the longer hair that came with the model and didn't do much else.

<div class='gap' />

Definitely not gonna get a 3D model of this sona, at least not yet, so I'm gonna keep using the model I have. I don't just wanna abandon this sona either, I still wanna have and use it, I just want *another* sona yknow?

Would love to get art of the character though! Maybe once I've put some more thought into it I'll get a ref sheet for him or something, I still need to get one for Invisy too tbh.

<div class='gap' />

This is kind of a personal thing, but, slowly I've just been straying away from being a furry? If that makes sense?
Like, I still follow furry artists and fursuiters on twitter, and of course use a furry pfp but like, idk it isn't a big part of my personality. Like, I just see it as having an animal pfp, less so of a "furry pfp".

And tbh I'm only a furry online, I don't do very much furry stuff irl. I don't go to cons, I don't own a fursuit, and it definitely **isn't** the first thing I tell someone about when introducing myself. However, I would actually love a partial; just a head, paws, and a tail.

<div class='gap' />

I don't really know what I'm trying to get at here? I'm not the best writer especially when it comes down to feelings and emotions.

But say I had art of this character I wanna make, literally just me but as an animal, it's kind of furry kind of not? Like I'd just me using my actual name and, *aside from it being an animal*, it would essentially just be a picture of me? I guess? I dunno.

It's currently 5:25am as I write this sentence and I've had zero sleep. I'm just trying to write some more stuff as I feel there's more to talk about but I just don't know what. I just wanna yap.
