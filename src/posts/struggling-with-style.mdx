As of recent, I've been struggling with designing an index page for my [main index](https://invisyarcticfox.uk).

I've been through so many different iterations but I can never seem to land on a design that I really like.

The thing I've had most trouble styling are these links.
<Image
  src={links} alt={'links'}
  width={720} loading={'eager'}
/>
I can never seem to land on a good style for them, and them alone have had about five different styles.

From [linktree](https://linktr.ee) style links to just plain text like in that image.

<Image
  src={icons} alt={'icons'}
  width={720} loading={'eager'}
/>
I know for a fact I want to keep how these are styled, I like them being icons rather than just text links.

And speaking of the icons, for as long as I can, I am absolutely keeping that twitter logo.
I **refuse** to use the new logo or call it "ùïè".

*Anyway, going back to style,* another thing I really like is this [catppuccin mocha](https://catppuccin.com/palette/) colour palette.
I've been debating whether to include the light theme or a toggle to go back to my "old style" which is just the background being [`#141414`](https://www.colorhexa.com/141414) and the text `#fff`, but I've turned off all analytics I can in cloudflare so I don't even know how many people even go to my website, let alone care about a light theme *(which even I don't, light themes suck :3)*

I'm quite happy with how the blog looks personally, just a list of blog posts with all the important information, and the actual blog post *itself* has more information and of course the contents. I like the width, I like the info at the top, looks good :)

I wanted to have background images for each blog post in a list, but wasn't sure what images to use, nor how to really incorporate it very well, so it's just grey instead!

I'm also very happy with how the page for my sona's art looks, I really like the visual of the bar at the bottom blurring the background and having the artist's username along with the date I got the art. Pretty simple in premise but visually it's just pretty pleasing.

Maybe one day after I've actually learned how to make a website look decent I'll figure out a style idk

I just don't wanna rip-off someone else's style or just copy all the concepts, I wanna actually make something *I* made.
