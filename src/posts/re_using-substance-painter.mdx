import { Image } from 'astro:assets'
import sp from '@img/substance/re/sp.png'
import sph from '@img/substance/re/sphoodie.png'
import front from '@img/substance/re/front.png'
import side from '@img/substance/re/side.png'


So, after two whole months, I actually finished retexturing the model :3

Although, I haven't been working on it for those two months. I restarted my progress a couple nights ago and actually finished it within a couple days. I guess I just didn't have the motivation to continue it since the last post.

<div class='two img'>
<Image src={sp} alt={'model'} width={720} loading={'eager'} />
<Image src={sph} alt={'hoodie'} width={720} />
</div>

<div class='two img'>
  <Image src={front} alt={'front'} height={720} />
  <Image src={side} alt={'side'} height={720} />
</div>

Pretty happy with how this *eventually* turned out. There's probably going to be stuff that I'll change later on, but most likely nothing too significant. Stuff like the size of the "**KILTRO**" logo or something.
